1) Filename and the component Name initials only starts with capital rest of it should be in small letter.
2) Extensions of file should also be in small letter.
3) All the media files should be inside assets folder
How it should look like 
assets/images
assets/icons
assets/video (GIF included)
4) The size of components lines should not exceed to 200 lines nearly.
5) Try to make as nested, Applying css only on single class will not work properly
6) Css class name should only start with small letter. It should not be in camel case notation. 
7) Component Name (Function Name / Class Name) should follow camel case notation. (Same as point no. 1).
8) Try to create seperate css files. Not mandatory to create seperate css file for every component, But try to
 seperate out atleast for Big components.
9) Use Link component from react router instead of anchor tag. Why? Because using anchor tag will reload the 
whole page, but Link component will only load mandatory component.
